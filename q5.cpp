/*
Q2: comments helps to remind or understand logic of program.
It is useful on teamwork, because all team members may have their own style of writing code and comments help to understand team members' code.


Q3: Javadoc (Java) and Doxygen (C++) allow you to write structured comments that are automatically converted into convenient documentation.


Q4: if programmer uses understandable names for functions, classes and variables, it is not necessary to use comments to understand logic.
However comments are necessary for large code or new developers.
